# Bargaining Game in Python
Module of the bargaining game in Python. Contains solution of Nash Bargaining Solution and Rubinstein Bargaining Solution.

## Nash Bargaining Solution
The Nash Bargaining Solution is a solution concept of a bargaining problem. It is intended to represent the most mutually beneficial agreement that the parties to the negotiation could make. The solution is based on the notion of a product space, which is the set of all possible utility vectors that could be obtained by the parties. The Nash Bargaining Solution is the utility vector that maximizes the product of the differences between the utility of each party and the reservation utility of that party.

## Rubinstein Bargaining Solution
The Rubinstein Bargaining Solution is a solution concept of a bargaining problem. It is intended to represent the most mutually beneficial agreement that the parties to the negotiation could make. The solution is based on the notion of a product space, which is the set of all possible utility vectors that could be obtained by the parties. The Rubinstein Bargaining Solution is the utility vector that maximizes the product of the differences between the utility of each party and the reservation utility of that party.
